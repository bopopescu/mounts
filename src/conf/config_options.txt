# ----- FILE NAME OPTIONS
filename		= Search based on the product filename, expressed according to the product naming convention
			= MMM_BB_TTR_LFPP_YYYMMDDTHHMMSS_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_OOOOO_DDDDD_CCCC



# ----- GEOGRAPHIC OPTIONS
footprint 		= Geographical search of the products whose footprint intersects or is included in a specific geographic type.
				= Supported inputs:
				[lat, lon]
				[lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, ...]
				POLYGON((lat1 lon1, lat2 lon2, ..., lat1 lon1)  #= WKT standard



# ----- SENSOR and ACQUISITION OPTIONS

platformname 		= Satellite Platform name (regardless of the serial identifier, e.g. A, B, C ...)
			= Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2

producttype		= output product type
			= SLC, GRD, OCN, S2MSI1C 
			
polarisationmode 	= valid polarisations for the S1 SAR instrument
			= HH, VV, HV, VH, HH HV, VV VH

sensoroperationalmode 	= SAR instrument imaging modes
			= SM, IW, EW

orbitdirection		= direction of the orbit (ascending, descending)
			= Ascending, Descending
			
swathidentifier 	= swath identifiers for the Sentinel-1 SAR instrument. 
			  S1-S6 swaths apply to SM products
			  IW, IW1-3 swaths apply to IW products (IW is used for detected IW products where the 3 swaths are merged into one image)
			  EW, EW1-5 swaths apply to EW products (EW is used for detected EW products where the 5 swaths are merged into one image)

cloudcoverpercentage 	= Percentage of cloud coverage of the product for each area covered by a reference band
			= 50 | [0 TO 100]



# ----- DATE OPTIONS
beginposition 		= time interval search based on the Sensing start Time of the products. 
endposition		= time interval search based on the Sensing start Time of the products. 
ingestiondate 		= time interval search based on the time of publication of the product on the Data Hub.
			
			= [<timestamp> TO <timestamp>]

			The <timestamp> value can be expressed in one of the the following formats:
			    (ISO8601) yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ
			    NOW
			    NOW-<n>MINUTE(S)
			    NOW-<n>HOUR(S)
			    NOW-<n>DAY(S)
			    NOW-<n>MONTH(S)



# ----- PAGING OPTIONS
maxrecords		= number of results listed per page 
orderby	 		= order result by
			    beginposition asc 	=> sorts results by sensing date arranged in ascending order
			    beginposition desc 	=> sorts results by sensing date arranged in descending order
			    ingestiondate asc 	=> sorts results by ingestion date arranged in ascending order
			    ingestiondate desc 	=> sorts results by ingestion date arranged in descending order 


# ---- EXTRA
--hub 			= data access point (see https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)
				=> API Hub : access point for API users with no graphical interface. All API users regularly downloading the latest data are encouraged to use this access point for a better performance.
                => Open Access Hub : access point for all Sentinel missions with access to the interactive graphical user interface.
